# Endless Running Game

![Game Screenshot](Coming Soon)

Welcome to the Endless Running Game. This is a simple web browser game, designed for both mobile and desktop devices.
The intention is to control a player character, which runs in place, and jump to avoid running obstacles and collect power-ups or other collectibles.
This is the first iteration of the project. If you would like to keep track of this project's progress, you may follow or favorite this project to follow along. 

## Study Objectives
In this project, the study objectives are to learn how to implement basic game mechanics, keep track of scoring and progression, and most of all, collision detection
all while using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
