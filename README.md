# Endless Running Game

Welcome to the Endless Running Game. This is a simple web browser game, designed for both mobile and desktop devices.
The intention is to control a player character, which runs in place, and jump to avoid running obstacles and collect power-ups or other collectibles.
This is the first iteration of the project. If you would like to keep track of this project's progress, you may follow or favorite this project to follow along. 

## Study Objectives
In this project, the study objectives are to learn how to implement basic game mechanics, keep track of scoring and progression, and most of all, collision detection
all while using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Objectives
- Iteration 1
   - Introduce a player sprite, an enemy sprite, a parallax background, and a basic menu. Ensure the player can jump and that the player can start and end the game at will.
- Iteration 2
  - Improve upon the physics of the game by introducing and perfecting collision boxes. Additionally, alter the player sprite's jump animation and other characteristics.
- Iteration 3
  - Introduce items which can be collected by the player to improve their score.
